# SwiftyMaps
 
View maps from OpenStreetMap (app is not affiliated with OSM organization).
Choose your own tile server. 
Preload tiles for offline use. 
Set place markers, add comments, take photos.
Record, import and export tracks in gpx format.
Free use, no ads.

This app has originally been a test, if it is possible to have a map view without Apple's MapKit.
As it worked out and is even faster than MapKit (depending on the tile server of course), it developed to a real app which now can be downloaded in the App Store.
